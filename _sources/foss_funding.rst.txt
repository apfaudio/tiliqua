Funding & Open Source
=====================

Where do I get a Tiliqua?
-------------------------

Tiliqua will be available on `Crowd Supply`_ first. If the campaign is successful, I will ship these units first and then plan to make Tiliqua available on my own webshop and potentially other retailers.

Funding
-------

We would like to acknowledge partial funding of the `Tiliqua project`_ from the `NGI Commons Fund`_, a fund established by `NLnet`_ with financial support from the European Commission's `Next Generation Internet`_ program.
