Calibration
###########

Background
----------

To support eurorack-level control voltages (CV), all inputs and outputs are DC-coupled. Audio codecs (such as the AK4619VN used here) are usually not designed for DC-coupled operation, which means that they often have quite large DC zero offsets and scaling terms compared to instrumentation converters.

.. note::

    Without any calibration at all, the inputs and outputs will should have an error < 150mV or so across the range. Most examples will deal with this fine, however if you are driving or being driven by Eurorack V/oct tunings, 1 semitone is in the order 80mV. So, if you need to be pitch-perfect, calibration is worthwhile.

To reduce the tracking error, each input and output supports independent DC offset and scale correction factors:

- For input ADCs, ``i = A * I + B``, where ``i`` is the calibrated input, ``I`` is the raw ADC count and ``A``, ``B`` are correction factors.
- For output DACs, ``O = C * o + D``, where ``o`` is the desired output, ``C`` and ``D`` are correction factors, and ``O`` is the raw DAC count.

Note that internally, the correction algorithm for inputs and outputs is identical. At the moment, audio samples are 16-bit fixed-point (shorthand ``ASQ`` in the code) with a range from ``-1..1`` where (when calibrated) ``+1 == +8.192V`` (i.e 4 raw counts per mV). Both input and output sides can support wider voltage ranges, however this is currently what the codebase uses everywhere, and wide enough for most purposes.

All correction factors are stored as 18-bit fixed-point numbers with a range ``-4..4``. Usually the scaling correction factors are close to ``1``, and the zeroing correction factors are close to ``0``.

Calibrating the ADCs/DACs
-------------------------

Pictured above, the ``selftest`` bitstream provides a semi-automated way of performing ADC/DAC calibration.
In short, the process is as follows:

- Disconnect all jacks. Power up Tiliqua, select ``selftest`` bitstream, ensure startup report is healthy.
- Switch to the ``AUTOCAL`` screen. The display will show the following options:

    - ``volts``: DAC reference level. This determines the value sent to the DAC. It is also subtracted from the ADC readings to form the 'delta' plot pictured on the main screen.
    - ``set``: Calibration coefficient to be automatically adjusted. The utility will adjust the selected coefficients until the 'delta' plot on the main screen has been zeroed.
    - ``autozero``: Enable autozero. When set to ``off``, nothing is adjusted. When set to ``run``, the selected calibration coefficients will be adjusted. Usually, you switch to ``run`` until the values are zeroed, then switch it off again.
    - ``write``: Write constants to non-volatile EEPROM and print them out the serial port.

- **Step 1** ADC zero:

  - With all jacks disconnected, set ``volts=0``, ``set=adc-zero``.
  - Switch ``autozero=run`` until the 'delta' plots hit zero. Switch back to ``autozero=stop``
  - You will notice the calibration equations at the bottom of the screen updated during the zeroing process.

- **Step 2** ADC scale:

  - Set an external precise voltage source to the desired test voltage, for example 3V.
  - With the first jack connected to your voltage source, set ``volts=3``, ``set=adc-scale``.
  - Switch ``autozero=run`` until the 'delta' plots hit zero.
  - Plug in the voltage source to the other jacks in sequence until they all also hit zero. Alternatively, you can just plug all the jacks into one voltage source at the same time, that's up to you.
  - Switch back to ``autozero=stop``
  - Now the ADCs are calibrated, you can test the range by injecting different voltages and adjusting ``volts`` to move the reference.

- **Step 3** DAC zero:

  - Now that all the ADCs are calibrated, we can use the ADC calibration to calibrate the DACs.
  - Connect all outputs to inputs in loopback with 4 patch cables (i.e. output 0 to input 0, output 1 to input 1 and so on).
  - Set ``volts=0``, ``set=dac-zero``. You will see see the DAC output zero offsets, as the ADCs were already zeroed.
  - Switch ``autozero=run`` until the 'delta' plots hit zero. Switch back to ``autozero=stop``

- **Step 4** DAC scale:

  - Set ``volts=3``, ``set=dac-scale``. The ADC readings should already be pretty close to the target.
  - Switch ``autozero=run`` until the 'delta' plots hit zero. Switch back to ``autozero=stop``

- **Step 5** Save the results

  - Select ``write`` from the menu and turn the encoder to save the calibration to non-volatile EEPROM on the eurorack-pmod PCBA. The constants are also printed out the serial port. On switching to other bitstreams or returning to this bitstream, the previous calibration will be loaded from EEPROM.

.. note::

    As of now, the calibration constants are only loaded from EEPROM in bitstreams that have an SoC. If you want to use the calibration constants in a bitstream without a SoC, for now you can copy and paste the serial-port dump into the default calibration you will find in ``eurorack_pmod.py``.

- **You are done!** optionally, you can also tweak the cal constants from the ``TWEAK-ADC`` and ``TWEAK-DAC`` screens.

.. note::

    During calibration, you may notice the DC offsets moving around ~10mV depending on whether the LEDs are on or off. Unfortunately there is no simple workaround for this as it seems the CODEC DC offsets depend on the CODEC supply voltage, despite us using a dedicated voltage reference. You may also see some higher offsets at high negative voltages. This is likely an artifact of us using the CODEC in an unsupported DC-coupled mode. In any case, it's best to do the calibration assuming the LEDs are ON, as that is the state they will be in most of the time Tiliqua is being used. In the future, it should be possible to even calibrate out the effect of supply voltage changes to the CODEC, as the Tiliqua knows at all times how much power the audio PCBA should be consuming.
