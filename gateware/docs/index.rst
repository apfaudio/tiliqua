    TLQ-MODULE and (optional) matching TLQ-SCREEN patched in a Eurorack System

Tiliqua is a **Eurorack Module**, which contains a debugger, FPGA and high-fidelity DC-coupled audio IOs, amongst lots of other features. It can store multiple bitstreams, and has a bootloader to select between them - making the hardware fully reconfigurable during live performance.

.. note::

    **If you just received Tiliqua hardware -- Quickstart is where you should begin!**
