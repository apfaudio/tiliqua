Tutorial 2: DSP blocks (``tiliqua.dsp``)
============================================

.. warning::

   This tutorial is not finished yet.

You have the option of re-using cores already present in Tiliqua's DSP library and connecting them together in different ways, or of building your own DSP blocks from scratch to add to the library.

In this tutorial, we'll start by implementing our own simple DSP block, and then integrate it with some of the existing blocks. The goal of this tutorial is to add a new DSP block to the library and use it in a new example bitstream in `gateware/src/top/dsp <https://github.com/apfaudio/tiliqua/tree/main/gateware/src/top/dsp>`_.

TODO

Finish writing this.
