Tiliqua Module [``TLQ-MODULE``]
###############################

**Tiliqua is shipped with a bunch of example bitstreams already flashed to it. So, to get started, all you need to do is connect the Eurorack +/- 12V ribbon cable, connect a screen, and then switch the Eurorack power on.**

.. warning::

    I recommend **only plugging or unplugging the display, power, or expansion headers while your system is OFF**. All other TRS jacks / USB connectors are fine to hotplug!

Connecting Power
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To power Tiliqua, you only need to connect the 16-pin Eurorack power input (+/- 12V) which, out of the box, is already attached to Tiliqua in the correct orientation.

.. note::

    Tiliqua comes with a rainbow power cable rather than a boring gray one. The connector is keyed correctly and the BROWN wire is the -12V wire. RED is still closest to -12V like on a standard gray one. Nothing bad will happen if you accidentally connect it backwards (on the 10-pin side), as Tiliqua has input diodes and fuses.

Connecting a Display
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Any standard monitor or projector (or our ``TLQ-SCREEN`` module) should work fine as a display for Tiliqua. In general, Tiliqua tries to use the native resolution of any attached screen. However, if the native resolution is higher than ``1280x720p60``, or no screen is connected at all, we always emit a display signal at ``1280x720p60`` as a fallback - as the vast majority of screens support this resolution.

Bootloader
^^^^^^^^^^

After powering on your system, you will be greeted by the bootloader screen:

.. figure:: /_static/bootloader_screen.png

From here, you can use the encoder to select one of 8 slots. As each slot is highlighted, the I/O mapping of each jack and plug is pictured on the right. You will notice some bitstreams have USB, some don't, some have a display output and others don't (like the audio-only bitstreams).

To reboot into a selected bitstream, just press the encoder button. **Once you're in a bitstream, you can always hold the encoder button down for 3sec (long press) to mute Tiliqua and re-enter the bootloader.**

.. note::

   At the moment, the screen resolution and/or any screen hotplugs are only detected in the bootloader. This is not a hardware limitation, but it does mean that for now you always need to be in the bootloader to change screen resolutions. The current resolution is displayed at the bottom of the bootloader screen.

   In general, bitstreams will show ``video: <match-bootloader>`` if they are able to inherit the resolution automatically detected by the bootloader. If a bitstream only supports a static mode, you will see something like ``video: 1280x720p60``. If a bitstream does not have any video output, you will see ``video: <none>``.


Menu / Help system
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In theory, each user bitstream could have a completely different UI. For now though, most bitstreams that have a display output and are shipped with Tiliqua follow the same menu UI. That is:

    - Each bitstream has multiple 'pages', where the first page is a 'HELP' page.
    - Rotating the encoder allows you to select a different menu option or the current page name.
    - If the current page name is selected, pressing the encoder will toggle between modifying the current page or not, rotating it will switch to a different page.
    - If normal option is selected, pressing the encoder will toggle between modifying the value or not, rotating it will increase or decrease the value.
    - In this way, you can access one of many pages and modify one of many options on each page with the single encoder.
    - If no option is selected for modification and we are not on the help page, the UI will disappear after some time (useful for generating visualizations).

Using Bitstreams
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Out of the box, Tiliqua ships with the following example bitstreams flashed. Many of them have built-in help pages. Here is a link to some more info on each one:

- :ref:`XBEAM <xbeam>`
- :ref:`POLYSYN <polysyn>`
- :ref:`MACRO-OSC <macro_osc>`
- :ref:`SID <sid>`
- :doc:`SELFTEST <../calibration>`
- :class:`DSP-MDIFF <top.dsp.top.PSRAMMultiDiffuser>`
- :class:`DSP-NCO <top.dsp.top.QuadNCO>`
- ``VEXIITOR``: Bonus bitstream, flashed to most Tiliquas, not quite ready to merge yet :)

.. warning::

    The documentation for each bitstream is not quite polished yet, but I hope there is enough material for you to be able to get started with the most important ones.

Jack LEDs
^^^^^^^^^

Normally, the Jack LEDs on each audio jack show the current voltage on the jack. However, whenever you are modifying an option or touching the encoder, the jack LEDs take on a different meaning.

This is because, in cases where you want to use a bitstream that has a menu system but **don't have space for a display** (and are extremely dedicated and memorised the menu) it is possible to navigate purely based on the jack LEDs!

    - If jack LED is green: we are selecting a page. The jack LED number (0-7) is the page number.
    - If jack LED is red: we are selecting an option. The jack LED number (0-7) is the option index.
    - If the jack LED is flashing: we are in 'modify' mode. If it is not flashing, we are NOT in 'modify' mode.
    - The bar graph LEDs around the encoder show the currently selected option's value on a scale from min (fully green) to max (fully red).

Touch Sensors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The capacitive touch sensors on each jack are calibrated when Tiliqua is turned on, and in some bitstreams (like POLYSYN), automatically re-calibrated every time a jack is plugged or unplugged. If you are having issues with 'ghost' touches, it's often worth power cycling tiliqua with nothing patched on the jacks you want to use for touch sensing.

USB: the ``dbg`` and ``usb2`` ports
-----------------------------------

For flashing bitstreams, you want the ``dbg`` USB port. This is routed to the on-board RP2040. For USB audio or USB device / host usage from bitstreams, you want the ``usb2`` USB port. This is routed through a ULPI PHY directly to the FPGA fabric.

Flashing/Updating Bitstreams
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You have 2 options:

- Use the **tiliqua-webflash** `(LINK) <https://apfaudio.github.io/tiliqua-webflash/>`_ tool, which works in any Chromium-based browser and allows you to flash bitstream archives to Tiliqua using any OS.
    - Note: on mac / windows this should work out of the box. On Linux, make sure you have udev rules configured so the device is accessible without ``sudo``!
- Using our ``pdm flash`` **command line tool**, which requires setting up the Tiliqua development environment first. More details in :doc:`../gettingstarted/building_flashing`.

.. note::

    Tiliqua has 3 persistent memory chips that come pre-flashed out of the box. **Flashing / updating bitstreams only touches the first one.**

        - On the 'Soldiercrab': one 16MB SPI flash for the FPGA: This one contains the bootloader bitstream and all the user bitstreams, and any saved options.
        - On the 'Motherboard':  16MB SPI flash for the RP2040 / debugger: this one contains the debugger firmware used as a bridge between the ``dbg`` USB port and the FPGA JTAG.
        - On the 'Audio Board': one small EEPROM for storing calibration constants, as well as the last entered bitstream used for autoboot. This contains the factory calibration.

    **Under the hood**: updating or changing the bootloader bitstream or user bitstreams is performed using an open-source tool called ``openFPGALoader``, as Tiliqua shows up as a ``dirtyJtag``-compatible debug adapter. Bitstreams for Tiliqua are distributed as *Bitstream Archives*, which contain firmware and metadata alongside the bitstream itself. For technical details on how this works, see :doc:`../bootloader`).


Calibration
^^^^^^^^^^^

Tiliqua is shipped with a factory calibration to within 5mV or so. If you want to get even better, you can try to calibrate it yourself by following the calibration sequence here: :doc:`../calibration`

.. warning::

    Before you conclude the NCO V/oct calibration is bad, note the calibration currently is only applied in bitstreams that have a menu system as reading the calibration uses a CPU. This limitation will be removed in a future update.
