Tutorial 4: SoC/CPU bitstreams
==============================

.. warning::

   This tutorial is not finished yet.

More advanced projects in this repository (such as :ref:`XBEAM <xbeam>`) contain audio and video logic, as well as a small CPU and peripheral cores: all connected together to form a SoC (*System-on-Chip*).

.. automodule:: tiliqua.tiliqua_soc


Building
--------

.. warning::

    Before proceeding with the *Building* and *Simulation* sections, make sure you have installed the required Rust toolchain: see the last section of :doc:`install`.

Assuming all the required dependencies are installed, building an SoC bitstream is no different to other types of bitstreams. For example, to build ``xbeam`` and create a flashable archive:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pdm xbeam build

.. note::

    Many of these examples are quite large, so they can take a while (1-2 minutes) to synthesize and route.

This one-line command hides some complexity. Under the hood, it will:

    - Instantiate the gateware design
    - Create an ``.svf`` file from it, which details every register in the SoC that the CPU should have access to.
    - Turn this into a Rust PAC (peripheral access crate) using ``svd2rust`` and ``form``: register definitions that our Rust firmware can use.
    - Compile our Rust firmware against the freshly-created PAC and package it into a flat binary which can be written to the SPI flash.
    - Elaborate the gateware design, send it through the synthesis flow.
    - Package the bitstream and firmware together into a flashable bitstream archive.

As with other bitstreams, you may want to add some flags depending on what you want. For example, to switch to 192kHz sampling and force the video mode to always be 1080p30:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pdm xbeam build --fs-192khz --modeline 1920x1080p30

Faster builds - only updating firmware
--------------------------------------

As the synthesis flow can take a long time to complete, it is annoying to have to wait for this to complete when you are only changing the firmware. For this reason, if you have already run a complete bitstream build at least once on any particular SoC bitstream and only want to update the firmware in the bitstream without resynthesizing the entire design, you can use the ``--fw-only`` flag:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pdm xbeam build --fw-only

This will recompile and repackage the firmware into a new bitstream archive, whilst re-using the last synthesized bitstream for the selected core.

.. warning::

    When using the ``--fw-only`` flag, make sure you don't change any flags compared to those that the original bitstream was synthesized with, unless you're sure they don't affect the hardware design. Otherwise your firmware may assume it's running on a different hardware design to the one it is actually running on!

Parallel builds
---------------

In general, ``yosys`` and ``nextpnr`` are dependent on single-core performance. So, building multiple bitstreams at once will scale well. Some example scripts for building multiple bitstreams in parallel can be found in ``scripts``, for example the following command will build most SoC bitstreams simultaneously:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ./scripts/build_bitstreams_soc.sh

This can be useful for testing changes that affect every bitstream, or supplying custom arguments. Any build arguments passed to ``build_bitstreams_soc.sh`` will be passed to each individual build invocation.

Simulation
----------

All SoC bitstreams support simulation. This works in the same way as other bitstreams using ``pdm <core> sim``, with the difference that it also performs the required firmware compilation step and puts some bootloader metadata in memory before starting the bitstream, to simulate a healthy launch by the Bootloader. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pdm selftest sim --trace-fst --modeline 720x720p60r2
    <...>
    run verilated binary 'build/obj_dir/Vtiliqua_soc'...
    sync domain is: 60000 KHz (16 ns/cycle)
    pixel clock is: 39070 KHz (25 ns/cycle)
    audio clock is: 12288 KHz (81 ns/cycle)
    Loaded bootinfo to PSRAM offset 0xfff000
    DVIDriver: frame00.bmp
    [INFO] Hello from Tiliqua selftest!
    DVIDriver: frame01.bmp

Any prints to the serial port will be sent to the terminal (e.g. ``[INFO] <...>``, and every frame of video will be saved to a bitmap, as the simulation is run. As we have supplied ``--trace-fst``, we will also get a ``simx.fst`` dump of every signal in the design, which can be viewed with ``gtkwave`` or ``surfer`` to debug any part of the design.

TODO

Finish writing this.
